There are several things remained to be developed:

-> The unit tests needs to be rewritten and many scenaries still needs to be covered.

-> Integration with docker and Kubernets, so the development and deployment proccess can be smoother.

-> AWS configuration: So the application can be deployed and accessed in production state.

-> Security: The microservers needs to be secured with an authorization algorithm, with a login and password, so the resources are protected and not exposed to undesired sources.
